Developed a machine learning model that can identify coding and non-coding regions in DNA sequences. 
This is a powerful tool that holds immense potential across various fields.
By pinpointing the parts of DNA responsible for protein production (coding regions) and understanding the regulatory or structural roles of non-coding regions, 
our model can revolutionize the way we approach genomics. It can assist in gene annotation, 
accelerate research into genetic diseases, and even contribute to designing synthetic DNA for biotechnological innovation.
This advancement not only saves time and resources but also opens doors to deeper insights into genetic functions,
evolutionary biology, and disease mechanisms, making it an invaluable asset for researchers and scientists worldwide.

I used datasets from Kaggle to train and develop my machine learning model.
